    ADD Dosis (font)
    ADD interactive demo 
    A tiny interactive demo in the accordion 
    (e.g., click +1 in binary, watch it go 1, 10, 11, 100…). 
    ADD white to the visuals 
    ADD Timer Button + logic 
    ADD Tooltipps 
    ADD a Demo for the game (How to play)

            Yes, but feel free to skip that for now. You are not required to
            become a mathematician just to play this game.

            Flip the cubes when you are lost, and watch out for (10) -> this
            tells you it's a the base you are used to (the decimal system).
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What even is a base?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            A base or number system is how you gather things (like marbles,
            balls or apples) and squash them into numbers. It's easier for your
            brain to remember them like this.
          </p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <img
            src="./assets/images/bowl-muddled.svg"
            alt="A bowl with some balls"
          />
          <p>
            Here the balls are all in disarray. <br />In the next picture the
            balls are arranged in twos.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/images/bowl-twos.svg"
            alt="A bowl with balls arranged in twos."
          />
          <p>You can arrange them in a different order as well:</p>
          <img
            src="./assets/images/bowl-tens.svg"
            alt="A bowl with balls arranged in tens."
          />
          <p>
            Here they are arranged in tens. In the next picture, they are
            arranged in fives.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./assets/images/bowl-fives.svg"
            alt="A bowl with balls arranged in fives."
          />
          <p>
            Notice that in every bowl, there are exactly 16 marbles*. <br />
            This is the goal of the game: To find the matching values,
            regardless of the number base you are in.
          </p>
          <p class="smaller">
            * 16 as counted in our decimal system, where you always count up to
            10, then start a "new" round: 10+6.
          </p>
          <p class="smaller">
            You might also notice that instead of 80(2) as expected, you count
            as 10000(2) when counting in twos. The reason for this is that you
            only restrict yourself to two digits, 1 and 0, so there is no 8 in
            this world (1 and 0's evil world domination agenda 😈), so you have
            to jump up a decimal point instead.
